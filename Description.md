# CodeWar

CodeWar is not a particularly fun game to watch: All you can see is tanks attacking each other, and last one remaining on the battle field wins.

The acutal fun part of this game happens in the codes. The tanks in this game are designed by programmers at UltronStar Gaming Workshop. In others words, the tanks are controlled by scripts and the scripts are written by the players. This is why we call it CodeWar.

I was responsible for designing the framework of this battlefield, namely the logic of this game. I implemented the shared properties of tanks: such as they are allowed to have 30 points of life each, when they get hit by bullet, their life drops; when they shoot bullets, the bullet stock decreases according to the bullet size and then recover at a fixed rate. I also wrote basic behaviours like attack, sense, scan, etc, for players to use when controllig their own tanks.

This game is highly adaptable, for anyone who want to join the fight, create a tank of your own, implement its behaviour, add it to the assets, and you can be on the battlefield, too!
