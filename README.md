# CodeWar

#### Introduction
CodeWar is co-designed by Ultron Star Workshop for entertainment(and coding practice) within programmers.

Each tank you see is designed by one of our members, we decide how it will detect its enemies, how it will attack, and how it will doge the bullets.

Design your own tank, implement its behaviour, and join our war!
